## Problem Statement

People often struggle to decide what to cook based on what they have in their kitchen. Most recipe apps offer static suggestions or pre-written recipes and lack personalization, local context, or multilingual support.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Solution

ChefGPT uses AI to dynamically generate customized recipes based on:

- User-provided ingredients
- Personal preferences (e.g., desi, fusion, vegetarian, low-budget)
- Cooking style (quick, stove-free)
- Language preference (English or Urdu)
- Optional nutrition info and shopping list(for ingredients missing from user input) generation

It aims to be a smart, culturally aware, and flexible cooking assistant.

## AI Workflow Notes (LLM + n8n)

- LLM prompt adapts to:
  - User's ingredients
  - Selected cooking style (quick, budget, veg)
  - Output language (English/Urdu)
  - Fusion toggle (e.g., turn Western dish Desi)

- Prompt examples:
  - "Generate a healthy, budget-friendly dinner using eggs, potatoes, and spices. Output in Urdu."
  - "Desify this Western recipe using Pakistani ingredients."

- Shopping list is **AI-generated from missing ingredients** based on recipe logic.
- Nutrition is estimated using language models (approximations, not database-backed).
